# ECE_110_Robot

This robot was designed to first measure the incline of the ramp in front of it using an accelerometer, then traverse a circle demarked by black tape using the light sensors on the bottom, then communicate the angle of the ramp to another robot. The other robot would then finally signal back a finishing routine for the robot to perform. Ther performed routine was either a dance, anthem, or light show. All the code for this routine is in Full_Integration.ino.
